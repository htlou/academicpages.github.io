Hi~ I'm Hantao Lou, an undergraduate student('26) majoring in Artificial Intelligence at Yuanpei College, [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). 

Currently I'm doing research at Center of AI Safety and Governance, Institute of Aritificial Intelligence, Peking University. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yaodong Yang](https://www.yangyaodong.com/).

At Peking University, I'm a member and the monitor of [Tong Class](https://tongclass.ac.cn/), an pilot class in Aritificial Intelligence.

My research interests mainly include Alignment of AI systems (*i.e.* making AI systems align with human value and intention), scalable alignment methods, and Responsible AI systems (*e.g.* Interpretability and Characteristic Evaluation of language models).
